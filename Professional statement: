I am driven to help build infrastructure that promotes smart practices to identify and analyze potential risks and threats. My mindset to always pursue learning, drives me to stay up to date with the constantly evolving landscape of cybersec. Currently being a Data analyst, I will use my unique skills to ensure policies like NACF CST, CIA remain constant while deploying tools like wireshark, tcpdump to analyze data and secure any vulnerabilities within the organization.
